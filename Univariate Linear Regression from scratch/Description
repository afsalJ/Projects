This is a learning project which solely focuses on understanding the concept of linear regression included with gradient boosting algorithm.
where we are going to identify m and b of the equation mx+b. We are using weight as our target column.

Meta Data:
(3, 2500)
column names: Index, Height(Inches), wieght(Pounds)
Algorithm:

step 1: Find the steepest descent by using the derivative of mean squared error function by each m(slope) and b(bias) which is initialized with 0.

step 2: Move in the opposite direction of the steepest descent by

           m = current_m - m_gradient * L 

           b = current_b - b_gradient * L

           Where L is the learning rate, I fixed it as 0.0001.

step 3: Repeat step 2 until we get same m and b values 5 times

step 4: now your m and b values are identified, so use it in the function to predict for new x values.
