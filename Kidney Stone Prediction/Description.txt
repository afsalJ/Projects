Problem description:
This project is a Kaggle competion entitled kidney Playground Series. 
The data given has the columns id, gravity, ph, osmo, cond, urea, calc and target.Target has either 1 or 0 as values ie.1 means have kidney stone and 0 means doesnt have kidney stone.

Approach:
step 1: Check for non correlated features in the given data with target.
Used correlation heatmap to identiy the relations.
Since id doesnt have any correlation ,I dropped 'id' column.

step 2:Determine the appropriate model
I have decided to use a dictionary having models such as Logistic Regression,KNN,SVM,Gradient Booster,Decision Tree,Random Forest.

I used a function named 'getScore' and 'score' to fit each of the models in the dictionary and find the score of predictions using accuracy score metrics

And by visualizing the accuracies ,I decided to choose SVM ie(Support Vector Classifier) Which has given more accuracy of 74%

Evaluation:
Here we are given a train and test data in which we have to train our model by train.csv and find the prediction for test.csv. Then we are evaluated with a score by comparing actual values of test data and our prediction.Note: We cannot know the actual target of test data.
